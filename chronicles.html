                                            <p>Ray Chang is a second-year bioengineering PhD student at Stanford University
                                                studying the fluid mechanics of the freshwater ciliate <i>Spirostomum
                                                    ambiguum</i>. Before starting his PhD at Stanford, Ray attended medical
                                                school with an interest in becoming a psychiatrist but was drawn to the
                                                excitement and innovation of research. He enjoys the interdisciplinary
                                                nature of biophysics and the use of physics to predict the limits of life.
                                                After completing his PhD, Ray hopes to start a career in academia to
                                                discover new knowledge on the microscopic world and to inspire others to do
                                                the same.</p>

                                <p style="font-weight: 800;">Q: First, I want to know more about your background, and
                                        there is no better person to speak about it than you, who has experienced it
                                        firsthand. Let’s start with: what are you doing now?</p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">A:</span> Hi! I am Ray Chang and I am a second-year
                                    bioengineering PhD student at Stanford. I am in Professor Manu Prakash’s lab, and I am
                                    working on the fluid mechanics problem of an interesting freshwater ciliate
                                    called <i>Spirostomum ambiguum</i> using both theoretical and experimental approaches.
                                    To be more specific, <i>Spirostomum</i> is a giant single cell organism (it can grow up
                                    to 4 mm in length!) with an exceptional ability to perform ultrafast contractions; the
                                    maximum acceleration in the contraction process can be up to 15G! A normal human cannot
                                    tolerate such high acceleration, but this organism uses the hydrodynamic pulse wave
                                    generated by the contraction as a communication tool and must be able to perform such a
                                    task repetitively without damaging itself. I am looking at the intracellular
                                    organization of this organism to see how the internal structure helps dissipate the
                                    energy generated in this process. </p>
                                <p>Aside from this project, I also play an assistant role in other frugal science projects
                                    related to the medical field in our lab because of my background in medicine. For
                                    example, our lab is working on converting a commercially-available snorkel mask into
                                    personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, or into an interface for
                                    noninvasive ventilation. I have worked on designing PPE donning, doffing and
                                    disinfection protocol, and some physiological testing. This dual role is very common in
                                    our lab: most of us work as the primary lead of our own project but also have a
                                    supportive role for other members’ projects.</p>
                                <p>In the long run, I am interested in pursuing an academic career, with a potential focus
                                    on cellular biophysics. There are many interesting problems in the unseen microscopic
                                    world. For example, how does a single cell sustain its needs when it grows to a large
                                    size? How does the cell transmit signals across the cell without an action potential? Is
                                    it a common strategy for cells to modify its internal structure for energy dissipation
                                    purposes? These are all fundamental questions which require careful experimental design
                                    from a strong theoretical point of view, which is why I find them so fascinating!</p>

                                <p style="font-weight: 800;">Q: Now that I have a better understanding
                                        of what you do, I want to know the “why” behind it. What is the driving force behind
                                        your work and what you pursue? Some topics to consider:</p>
                                <ol style="font-weight: 800;" type="a">
                                    <li>Why did you decide to pursue a career path in STEM, particularly in bioengineering?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Why did you choose academia over industry?</li>
                                    <li>What motivates you to pursue your various research interests?</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">A:</span> This is an interesting question. I think the
                                    most important reason why I am a researcher is because it is fun. It is fun to ask these
                                    seemingly random questions which actually carry serious fundamental meanings. It is fun
                                    to see what life (other than model organisms) looks like and how they evolve really
                                    fascinating strategies to tackle the problems unique to their scale. If you want to
                                    learn more about how fun such a world could be, I encourage you to explore a therapeutic
                                    YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/microcosmos">“Journey to the
                                        Microcosmos”</a>. While I wanted to study biophysics in graduate school, I couldn’t
                                    apply for a PhD in a biophysics program because of funding issues surrounding my
                                    foreigner status. Instead, I was able to apply for a bioengineering program because it
                                    provides a more quantitative point of view compared to other branches in bioscience.
                                    However, I think bioengineering is a good fit for me as its fundamental research matches
                                    my interests while its application matches my abilities. </p>
                                <p>One reason why I am currently aiming for an academic career is because I enjoy teaching.
                                    I hope that a more quantitative mindset can someday become the second “central dogma” in
                                    biology: living organisms have to obey the laws of physics, and these laws set a
                                    predictable constraint on what they can do and how they can perform a specific task. In
                                    my 4th year of medical school I started a blog called “Three Minute Biophysics” to
                                    educate myself and others about both classic and modern research in biophysics. I like
                                    to share with other people joyful and insightful moments when physics and biology marry
                                    together, and I think those tiny moments are what motivate me to explore all the
                                    unanswered questions we have about biology. </p>
                                <p>The other reason why I am considering an academic job is because I appreciate the freedom
                                    of academia. I want to work on something that I genuinely find interesting, even if its
                                    application may not be evident at first glance. I believe that only through studying
                                    these peculiar microorganisms can we truly understand the limits of life and what a
                                    living creature is capable of. Staying in academia after graduation will allow me to
                                    continue studying unique microorganisms that are seemingly unimportant but could provide
                                    novel solutions to the problems we have today. </p>
                                <p style="font-weight: 800;">Q: The journey itself is often more than
                                        the results. How did you end up doing what you do now and what happened in the
                                        process?</p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">A:</span> I entered medical school after high school
                                    because I was not sure about what I wanted to do. Even though I had been thinking about
                                    doing research back then, I didn’t feel passionate enough about pure biology research to
                                    major in biology. I was also interested in physics but was not very confident in my
                                    abilities to major in physics. During my freshman year, I got really interested in
                                    psychology. I spent all my free time voraciously reading all kinds of psychology books
                                    and I thought I would one day become a psychiatrist.</p>
                                <p>However, in my sophomore year, I felt that I had learned enough psychology to interpret
                                    and handle my own personality and interpersonal relationship problems, and psychology
                                    became less interesting to me. I decided to take a psychology and a physics elective at
                                    the same time to see which one I enjoyed more. The physics class I took was
                                    “Introduction to Biophysics” taught by Dr. Po-Ling Kuo, and it completely changed my
                                    life. I was so inspired by how physics can be used to predict a diverse range of
                                    biological problems, and I really enjoyed the textbook, “Physical Biology of the Cell”
                                    written by Rob Phillips. After chatting with Dr. Kuo during an office hour about my
                                    interests in pursuing biophysics, he invited me to join his lab and I worked with him
                                    part time for 4 years.</p>
                                <p>After joining Dr. Kuo’s lab, I prepared myself for a career in biophysics. I knew that my
                                    physics and math abilities were not going to be as good as a physics major student, so I
                                    devoted all my free time to self-studying physics and math. I was very lucky to have a
                                    friend who was also interested in physics and would study with me, and I miss the times
                                    when he would message me with a question and ask me to solve it. As medical school
                                    classes were quite heavy, I had to stay in the library for the entire day and even on
                                    weekends. Even though that may sound miserable, I appreciated that time when I could
                                    enjoy the pure joy of knowledge.</p>
                                <p>7 years of medical school was still a long journey and I had questioned my decisions from
                                    time to time. Over the 7 years, I thought about becoming a psychiatrist, nephrologist,
                                    pathologist, cardiologist and neurologist at different stages of my training while still
                                    doubting my abilities to study physics. However, I am glad that constant exposure to the
                                    inspiration of research helped me overcome my doubt and pointed me in the direction I
                                    should go. When I would write a new post for my blog introducing others’ great work, I
                                    wished that I could become part of that community. I wished I could try to explore my
                                    own limits, and to one day introduce my own work on my blog! With that in mind, I
                                    decided to apply for graduate school during my final (internship) year in medical
                                    school.</p>
                                <p>In my intern year, I had more responsibilities taking care of patients and needed to
                                    regularly stay on duty, which gave me a chance to imagine what my life would be like if
                                    I decided to stay in hospital work. I felt the need to constantly engage in difficult
                                    conversations around patient status and the uncertainty around staying on duty was
                                    draining to me. Even though I performed very well during my internship and received
                                    positive feedback from my senior colleagues, I felt that I was giving the patients
                                    suboptimal care because I was not the best possible “me”. In addition, I realized that
                                    the emotional burden of working at a hospital prevented me from maintaining my
                                    biophysics studying hobby, which forced me to make a decision between the two. Luckily,
                                    I got into Stanford with God’s help and my past investment in applying for graduate
                                    school, and I really appreciate the chance.</p>

                                    <div class="col l12">
                                        <p>As a college student, the advice I would give is to explore your interests and
                                            start preparing yourself early. I would not have been admitted to graduate
                                            school if I only started preparing for it in my 5th or 6th year of medical
                                            school. Having a clear direction is more important than blindly wasting your
                                            efforts. Spend your time exploring your passions when the cost of failure is
                                            still low, really dive into the one that you love, and plan early for your
                                            long-term goals. I hope everyone can eventually work on something they are
                                            passionate about!</p>
                                        <p>Another thing that I found very helpful is to embrace a growth mindset.
                                            Intelligence can be built and we should believe in our abilities to learn. There
                                            is a stereotype that students in biology or medicine are bad at math and
                                            physics, and I think that is very toxic and detrimental. I would not have the
                                            courage to apply to graduate school and to work on my current project if I
                                            didn’t believe in my ability to learn, and trust in yourself takes time and
                                            effort to nurture.</p>

                                        <p>I was very lucky to have graduated from Taipei Municipal Jianguo (former name
                                            Chien-Kuo) Senior High School, a high school that gives its students more
                                            freedom than any other high school. Every student is encouraged to do whatever
                                            they want, and there is a strong atmosphere in the school that if you want to do
                                            something, you should aim for the best. Therefore, our high school is famous in
                                            almost every aspect: from international science Olympiad, science fair, pop
                                            dance club, rugby team, to color guard team, because everyone is aiming for the
                                            best. I also remember when I had naturalist hobbies such as plant
                                            identification, and I bought many plant atlases just to study how to
                                            differentiate them. I encourage everyone to be serious about the things you
                                            like, and really invest time to do research on it and to practice [what you
                                            learned].</p>

                                        School</h3>
                                <p>I also have advice for people who are interested in medical school. There are many
                                    aspects of medicine that are very different from what ordinary people imagine a medical
                                    career to be. Uncovering the mysteries of the human brain or finding cures for cancer
                                    are not going to be a major part of your training, and your hospital volunteering
                                    experiences will be very different from a usual day as a healthcare worker. A huge
                                    aspect of medicine is having to communicate terrible news to an already shattered
                                    family. As you get more and more accustomed to the practical know-how of taking care of
                                    a patient, it is possible to become emotionally worn out by seemingly trivial details
                                    that actually become huge roadblocks to treatment flow, such as health insurance status,
                                    bed availability of post-acute care facilities, or missing family members who hold the
                                    power to make decisions for a patient. Think carefully before you apply to medical
                                    school, and remember to take care of yourself if you are admitted.</p>
